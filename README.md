# Natural_Language_Processing

Creating systems that could understand and process natural language, thereby
 using it for various applications.
 
Using Naive bayes network to classify sentences. Online feedback is used as
 data and is used to train the system to know whether a sentence is positive
  or negative. Reviews from the product which I have bought from an online
   shopping website is used for training and experimenting the program.
