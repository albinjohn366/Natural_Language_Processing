# Natural_Language_Processing

Creating systems that could understand and process natural language, thereby
 using it for various applications.
 
 Topic modelling is nothing but identifying from a sequence of texts, what
  the topic really is. This would involve finding words that are most
   frequently used. Even though this can give the key words, there might be
    situations where function words such as 'and', 'the', etc occurs more
     frequently than content words. Hence there is a need to ignore function
      words. On the other hand, the most basic and important thing is to find
       the words that are more frequently used in the particular document
        compared to all other documents. Various data sets of function words
         and list of documents are needed for this process.
